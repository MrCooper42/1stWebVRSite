                                one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

                            <p> I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff,
                                but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. In my experience,
                                there is no such thing as luck. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. What?! Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several
                                transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I call it luck.
